        <b>Usage of Aadhaar</b>
      </p>

      <div class="para1">
        Government of India funds a number of social welfare schemes focused
        towards the poor and most vulnerable sections of society. Aadhaar and
        its platform offer a unique opportunity to the government to streamline
        their welfare delivery mechanism and thereby ensuring transparency and
        good governance.
      </div>

      <b>For Governments, Service Agencies</b>
      <br />
      <div class="para2">
        The UIDAI issues Aadhaar number to residents only after de-duplicating
        their demographic and biometric attributes against its entire database.
        Aadhaar authentication enables elimination of duplicates under various
        schemes and is expected to generate substantial savings to the
        government exchequer. It also provides the government with accurate data
        on beneficiaries, enables direct benefit programs, and allows the
        government departments/service providers to coordinate and optimize
        various schemes. Aadhaar will enable implementing agencies to verify
        beneficiaries and ensure targeted delivery of benefits.<b>
          All these activities will lead to:</b>
      </div>

      <b>Curbing Leakages through Targeted Delivery:</b>
      <div class="para3">
        Welfare programs where beneficiaries are required to be confirmed before
        the service delivery, stand to benefit from UIDAIâ€™s authentication
        services. This will result in curbing leakages and ensuring that
        services are delivered to the intended beneficiaries only. Examples
        include subsidized food and kerosene delivery to Public Distribution
        System (PDS) beneficiaries, worksite attendance of Mahatma Gandhi
        National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) beneficiaries, etc.
      </div>

      <br />
      <b>Improving Efficiency and Efficacy:</b>
      <div class="para4">
        With the Aadhaar platform providing accurate and transparent information
        about the service delivery mechanism, government can improve
        disbursement systems and utilize scarce development funds more
        effectively and efficiently including better human resource utilisation
        involved in the service delivery network.
      </div>

      <br /><b>For Residents</b>
      <div class="para5">
        Aadhaar system provides single source offline/online identity
        verification across the country for the residents. Once residents enrol,
        they can use the Aadhaar number to authenticate and establish their
        identity multiple times using electronic means or through offline
        verification, as the case may be. It eliminates the hassle of repeatedly
        providing supporting identity documents each time a resident wishes to
        access services, benefits and subsidies. By providing a portable proof
        of identity that can be verified through Aadhaar authentication on-line
        anytime, anywhere, the Aadhaar system enables mobility to millions of
        people who migrate from one part of the country to another.
